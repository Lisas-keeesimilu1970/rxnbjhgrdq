Man, just got done watching Control Freak, and honestly, wow. Like, seriously, that movie had me on edge the whole time. I didn't expect that plot twist. I mean, who would've thought the guy with the glasses, you know, Mr. Nice Dude, would have such a dark side? I literally had to pause for a bit to process everything. So wild.

I had this plan to download the movie and watch it later, but then it was one of those “must watch right now” moments, you know? So glad I did. The way the director played with fire, like both literally and metaphorically, was insane. Does every movie these days have to include an explosion? Not that I'm complaining, though! Pretty epic stuff.

Anyway, you know how everyone's always saying, trust no one, well, this movie hammered that into my brain like fifty times over. Seriously. I don't even feel like trusting my own kettle now, haha! And that soundtrack? Absolute banger. I might have been bobbing my head a bit too aggressively at some point... my neck is still sore. 

> I can't even with that scene where the character's trying to hotwire the car in the rain. Isn't that, like, every movie ever? But here, it actually made sense. Just when I thought I couldn't be surprised, bam, they hit me with that and I was like, “Yep, that’s actually pretty clever.”

Was going to make popcorn halfway through, but no way I was leaving the screen for even a second. Man, those jump scares. My heart, like, skipped a beat. One jump scare almost made me choke on my soda! Not cool, movie, not cool.

char buffer[256]; // Random code insert... What was I even thinking?

Well, now I've got to pick something super light to watch before bed, otherwise, I'm gonna have dreams about being chased by control-happy robots or something... spooky stuff. What about you? Have you caught it yet? If not, seriously, go watch the movie. You're in for a treat.
